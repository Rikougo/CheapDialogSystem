# CheapDialogSystem
A simple dialog system with editor assisted dialog's asset creation. It is orignally based on [this awesome resource](https://github.com/merpheus-dev/NodeBasedDialogueSystem) and I plan on adding things and doing things my own way.

## How to use
The package provide a view to edit/create DialogContainer.asset using graph edition. You can then use those assets as you want using the data they hold.

## Current road map
- [] Improve dialog graph editor with colors and better asset selector
- [] Modular conditional dialog branch
- [] Modular action during dialog 
- [] Portraits on dialogs
